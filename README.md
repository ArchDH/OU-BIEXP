大阪大学宮本研免震実験データ分析用Pythonコード集
This Github Resporitory was created by DONGHA KIM who was a master's student during 2017-2019 at Osaka University, Miyamoto Laboratory. Since the data obtained from shaking table experiments were too inconvinient to analysis, I wrote a bunch of Python codes for better analyting performance. Those codes are shared in this folder. Any questions or advice will be pleasurely accepted.
